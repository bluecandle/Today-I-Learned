# DDD (Domain Driven Design)
Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

- placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
- basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
- initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
