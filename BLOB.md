# Blob (Binary large object)

The **`Blob`** object represents a blob, which is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a `[ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)` so its methods can be used for processing the data.

Blobs can represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The `[File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)` interface is based on `Blob`, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system.

a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob. Database support for blobs is not universal.
